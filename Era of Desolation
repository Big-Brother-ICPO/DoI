From Desolation to Prosperity

The Cataclysmic Birth (0 - 300)
Continental Beginning

The formation of Igir began with the most violent natural event recorded in planetary history—a supervolcanic eruption beneath the ocean’s surface. For centuries, the deep waters were still, but tectonic shifts and mounting pressure within the earth’s mantle eventually culminated in a catastrophic upheaval. The eruption unleashed an incomprehensible volume of magma, ash, and molten rock, reshaping the seafloor into an expanse of fiery destruction.

For nearly 300 years, the supervolcano’s continuous activity drove the creation of a new landmass. Towering plumes of smoke filled the sky, casting the surrounding seas in an eerie, perpetual twilight. As the magma cooled and solidified, it formed jagged cliffs and craggy landscapes dotted with volcanic vents still spewing sulfuric gasses and molten rock into the air. This was a realm of both birth and death—a land formed by raw, unbridled power and shaped by elemental chaos.

The newly formed land of Igir was initially hostile to life. Its surface was a scorched, barren expanse where rain, when it fell, turned to acidic steam upon contact with the molten rock. Geysers erupted violently, sending boiling water skyward, while rivers of lava carved their way through the landscape, occasionally merging into massive calderas that dotted the terrain. The land was rich with minerals, but it was devoid of soil, vegetation, or shelter. It was a realm of fiery creation, marked by the primal forces of earth and heat.

Yet, amidst the chaos, life began to find a foothold. The first to adapt were the Khamadmi, a species that evolved uniquely to this volatile environment. Originally aquatic creatures, the Khamadmi were driven from the seas by the upheaval. With tough, scaled skin and bipedal mobility, they were capable of withstanding extreme temperatures and traversing the rugged volcanic terrain. Their sharp, barbed teeth and powerful jaws enabled them to prey on both sea creatures washed ashore by violent tides and any early life that dared to emerge from the cooling ash fields.

The Khamadmi became the dominant predators of this nascent land, embodying its brutality and resilience. They not only survived but thrived, claiming territories along the rocky coastlines and venturing further inland as the land gradually cooled. The Khamadmi’s territorial behavior made them formidable guardians of the newly formed continent, turning Igir into a natural fortress of fiery peril.

By the end of the 300-year formation period, volcanic activity began to subside, and the land showed the earliest signs of stabilization. Volcanic rock, rich in minerals, slowly started to weather under the combined forces of wind and the first gentle rains, creating the initial layers of nutrient-rich soil. Early life forms were limited to hardy lichens and mosses that clung to crevices where moisture collected, signaling the beginning of Igir’s slow transformation from a desolate wasteland to a land capable of sustaining more complex life.

While the Khamadmi were the first to adapt, the coming centuries would see the emergence of new forms of life—creatures evolving slowly within the mineral-rich soils left behind by the volcanic eruptions. These conditions, though still harsh, laid the groundwork for future ecosystems that would later support the rise of human civilization.

The Cataclysmic Birth set the tone for Igir’s early history: a land forged in fire and defined by survival, a world where only the most adaptable could endure. The Būtrani were the first to locate this newly formed land, and it was into this landscape that the Būtrani exiled thousands to a land still in the process of becoming, a stage set by nature’s rawest elements for the unfolding drama of human struggle, adaptation, and eventual unity. The continent’s volcanic birth was not merely the beginning of a landmass but the start of a grueling and transformative era that would shape its history for millennia to come.

Exile Exodus (0 - 150 ED)
Primal Instinct

The Būtrani, a distant civilization known for their strict social structures and relentless pursuit of order, had long faced a growing problem. Their cities were overcrowded, and their streets teemed with the homeless, the destitute, and the condemned. Driven by both pragmatism and cruelty, the Būtrani devised a harsh solution. In 0 ED (Era of Desolation), they launched an expedition of voyagers to the newly discovered land of Igir—a volatile, barely habitable continent born of violent eruptions and still wreathed in steam and ash. The voyagers deemed the land unfit for Būtrani colonization due to its wild nature, but the leaders back home saw it as an ideal place to dispose of unwanted souls.
The exiles were a diverse group: criminals, political dissidents, and those deemed expendable by the social elite. A fleet of ships carried the first 3,000 exiles, each individual bearing a mark of shame burned into their flesh—a stark reminder of their banishment. As the fleet approached the shores of Igir, the landscape came into view: a rugged, smoke-hazed land with jagged peaks and vast expanses of black volcanic rock. The Būtrani had provided minimal provisions, assuming that most would perish within a matter of years. This was not a relocation—it was a death sentence.
Upon disembarkation, chaos reigned. The exiles, already weakened from the arduous journey and demoralized by their forced removal from Būtrani society, scrambled for the meager supplies left on the beaches. Fights broke out almost immediately, as food and tools became the first tokens of power in this harsh new world. Groups formed quickly, based on previous affiliations, tribal instincts, or mere convenience. Some sought to explore the interior of the continent in search of resources, while others stayed by the shore, hoping for a miracle that would not come.
The initial survival rate was grim. Many succumbed to the inhospitable environment within weeks, either by starvation, exposure, or the predation of Khamadmi. By the time the second wave of exiles arrived six years later, the landing zone was strewn with half-buried remains—some decomposing naturally, others stripped to the bone by scavenging Khamadmi. The new arrivals were shocked by the conditions, but desperation forced them to adapt quickly.
Over the next 150 years, the Būtrani continued to send small groups of 250 exiles at regular intervals. They had no contact with the exiles and no interest in their fate. By the time the last transport arrived in 150 ED, the exile population had dwindled to around 1,200 survivors. Though they remained divided into small groups, they had begun to develop rudimentary survival strategies. They scavenged what little they could find, from sharp stones to durable driftwood, and began to craft basic tools and weapons. Stone knives, spears tipped with obsidian, and simple slings made from braided plant fibers became essential tools in their fight for survival.
The exiles discovered that survival required more than brute strength; it required resourcefulness. Those who ventured inland found caves to shelter them from the fierce elements, while others built raised huts from fallen trees, using vines as ropes. In extreme cases, desperate survivors even resorted to weaving ladders from the hair of the dead to construct elevated defenses against the Khamadmi. These creatures, still the dominant predators of the continent, forced the exiles to adopt increasingly creative strategies for defense, such as luring the Khamadmi into pit traps lined with sharp stones.
Despite the hostile conditions, a basic understanding of the land began to emerge. Early foragers identified small patches of hardy vegetation, some of which proved edible, while others were used for medicinal purposes. The discovery of a tough, starchy root named Doya provided a modest but reliable food source, offering a measure of stability to those who cultivated it. The exiles’ growing familiarity with the terrain and its resources marked the earliest steps toward adaptation, albeit driven by the desperation of survival.
However, the harshness of the environment continued to shape the exiles’ relationships with one another. The scarcity of resources led to violent conflicts between groups, each vying for control of vital supplies. Cannibalism, a dark reality born of absolute need, became more prevalent as the exiles faced prolonged famine. Only the strongest or most cunning managed to survive, giving rise to a new kind of leadership—one based not on rank or birthright, but on the ability to ensure the survival of the group.
By the end of the Exile Exodus, the people of Igir were no longer simply Būtrani outcasts; they had become something different altogether. Shaped by the land’s cruelty and forced to adapt to the ever-present dangers, they had developed a sense of fierce resilience. Though scattered and divided, their struggle had planted the seeds of a uniquely Igiri identity—one defined by an unyielding will to endure, despite the grim odds.
With the completion of the final transport in 150 ED, the Būtrani's involvement with Igir came to an end. Yet, the story of the exiles was just beginning, as they faced an uncertain future in a land where the greatest battles were still to come—both against the continent’s predators and among themselves.

The Feast of Shadows (150 - 153 ED)
Madness by Desperation

The final Būtrani transport in 150 ED marked a significant turning point for the exiles of Igir. With no further arrivals, the people were forced to accept their fate—this desolate land was their only reality. Despite their attempts at adaptation, resources remained painfully scarce, and food supplies continued to dwindle. This scarcity intensified hostilities among the exiles, and the fragile social structures that had begun to form started to crumble. It was a time of unparalleled desperation, and it would soon culminate in the most brutal chapter of early Igiri history: the Feast of Shadows.
By this time, roughly 600 exiles remained, divided into small, desperate groups across the southeastern coasts and inland regions of Igir. Relations between these groups were tenuous at best, with occasional truces broken as swiftly as they were made. Trust was scarce, as rumors of betrayal, theft, and even cannibalism circulated widely. Survival became a zero-sum game—one could only gain by the losses of another. The first signs of the coming slaughter were subtle but deadly. Disappearances, once rare, became common, and small skirmishes quickly escalated into all-out conflict.
The Feast of Shadows began in late 151 ED, sparked by a raid on a small group’s food reserves near the coastal cliffs. This attack was not an isolated incident; it was the prelude to a chain of retaliatory strikes that soon engulfed the entire southeastern region. Fueled by rage and desperation, the groups became locked in a relentless cycle of violence. Alliances, forged for convenience, broke apart as soon as the promise of more food or resources became apparent elsewhere. The exiles were no longer merely struggling to survive—they had turned on each other, consumed by a primal need to dominate, even at the cost of their humanity.
Over the course of nearly three months, the killings reached a new level of savagery. It was not just a matter of taking what was needed but also of eliminating potential threats to future survival. Each group, now operating under an unspoken doctrine of total war, sought to annihilate competitors entirely. This meant not only raiding food stores but also slaughtering every man, woman, and child to prevent revenge or reprisal. The brutality was so extreme that some groups began to leave traps laden with poisoned meat or spiked pits, aiming to cripple or kill potential raiders before direct conflict could even occur.
Cannibalism, which had previously been a grim last resort, became a calculated strategy. Many exiles viewed it as not just a means of survival but a psychological weapon, using it to instill fear and break the spirits of weaker groups. The Khamadmi, ever opportunistic predators, also took advantage of the chaos. Drawn by the scent of blood and the sounds of battle, they attacked the combatants indiscriminately, often tearing through both sides of a conflict before retreating into the shadows.
By the beginning of 152 ED, less than 400 exiles remained. The survivors were hardened, driven by the basest instincts. Those still alive were skilled in evasion and combat, having learned to navigate the rocky terrain and use the volcanic landscape to their advantage. The deepening hunger, coupled with the relentless violence, began to wear down even the most resilient among them. Many succumbed to starvation or the elements, their bodies left as grim markers on a land already littered with death.
Amidst the horror, a few individuals retained a faint glimmer of humanity. These rare figures, often skilled healers or herbalists, attempted to mediate conflicts or tend to the wounded. However, their efforts were largely in vain, as trust was a forgotten concept. One notable healer, an exile named Yela, managed to convince a small group to spare another group’s children during a raid, marking one of the few merciful acts of the era. Yela’s story, though a rare exception, would later become a symbol of endurance, representing a fragile hope that humanity was not entirely lost in the darkness.
The turning point of the Feast of Shadows came in mid-152 ED, when the larger groups, now reduced to mere fragments of their former numbers, could no longer sustain constant warfare. Resources were so depleted that further conflict became almost impossible. Instead of fighting, the exiles began to scavenge the dead—both human and Khamadmi—for anything useful. Bone tools, sinew ropes, and makeshift weapons became essential for the remaining survivors, who no longer had the energy or numbers to launch full-scale attacks. The landscape became eerily quiet, as those still alive focused solely on subsistence, abandoning the thought of conquest.
The Feast of Shadows came to an end not through peace but through sheer attrition. By mid-153 ED, only around 200 survivors remained, scattered and divided across the landscape. Weakened and broken, they were little more than remnants of a once-larger group of exiles. It was a period defined by absolute despair, where the pursuit of survival had reached its lowest, most desperate depths. With the end of the Feast of Shadows, the survivors faced an uncertain future in a land where the greatest battles were still to come—not just against Igir’s harsh landscape and fierce predators, but within the hearts of the people themselves.

The Feast of Shadows marked the lowest point of human existence on Igir. It was an era defined by absolute desperation, where the concepts of trust and unity were discarded in favor of raw survival. However, it also set the stage for change. The survivors, scarred by the horrors they had witnessed and perpetrated, carried with them the hard-earned understanding that no one could thrive alone in such a hostile land. It was this realization, born of darkness and death, that would eventually lead to the tentative beginnings of diplomacy and the first steps toward a more unified existence in Igir.



The Khamadmi Extermination Campaign (153 - 200ED)
Military Action

As the survivors of the Feast of Shadows struggled to recover from years of relentless conflict, they found themselves facing a different but equally pressing threat: the Khamadmi. These predators, once opportunistic scavengers of human conflicts, had reclaimed their dominance over the land, emboldened by the reduced human population. The survivors, now numbering fewer than 200, realized that survival was impossible without addressing the ever-present danger of these creatures.
The seven remaining tribes—Dyenra, Udrade, Kokhran, Kl̴enka, Dl̴ushˠ, Radye, and Myoras—emerged as the core of the scattered survivors. Each had developed a keen awareness of the Khamadmi’s behaviors and weaknesses through years of harrowing encounters. Though the tribes remained wary of one another, they understood that a coordinated effort was essential to reduce the Khamadmi threat. For the first time since their arrival on Igir, there was a shared goal that transcended tribal divisions, however fragile that unity might have been.
The Khamadmi were formidable predators, with their barbed teeth and powerful, agile bodies adapted perfectly to Igir's rugged landscape. They moved with surprising speed on two legs but struggled greatly when forced onto their stomachs or backs. This weakness, noted by several tribes during earlier battles, became the focus of a new strategy: to trap and exterminate as many Khamadmi as possible in order to reclaim vital territories for human use.
Around 160ED, the tribes discovered a crucial resource for their campaign—Konueno Mesha, a type of rope made from the vines of a hardy plant coated with a potent oil derived from the Konueno fish. These fish, inhabiting the shallow coastal waters, were highly toxic when consumed, but their oil, once extracted, had unique properties that made the Mesha both flexible and extremely durable. The exiles had learned of the fish’s toxic nature through tragic trial and error, but this discovery turned a dangerous liability into a key asset.
Using the Konueno Mesha, the tribes devised a plan to trap the Khamadmi en masse. They created large boulder nets by tying stones together with the Mesha and lining narrow ravines, which they dubbed "Mi'khamadmi Remoshe," or "Predator’s Throat." These ravines were strategically chosen based on the Khamadmi’s known hunting patterns, making them ideal sites for ambush. The tribes would lure the Khamadmi into these pathways with bait—often captured game or even the bodies of fallen exiles—before releasing the boulders from the cliffs above. The traps were designed to incapacitate or kill the Khamadmi swiftly, preventing them from escaping or counterattacking.
The initial attempts were risky and met with mixed results. Some Khamadmi managed to escape the traps, causing casualties among the hunters. However, the tribes persisted, refining their techniques and learning from each failure. Over time, the campaign began to yield significant success. The Khamadmi, once fearsome and seemingly unstoppable, began to diminish in number, and their presence in the southeastern regions weakened. By 175ED, the seven tribes had established themselves as the dominant force in the region, reclaiming vital hunting grounds and establishing safer territories for their people.
The Khamadmi Extermination Campaign marked a critical turning point in the Era of Desolation. The tribes were no longer simply reacting to threats; they had begun to shape their environment actively. This shift in mindset signified more than just a temporary alliance—it was the beginning of strategic thinking and collective planning that would later become central to the development of civilization on Igir. It was a triumph of ingenuity over instinct, as the tribes recognized that collaboration, even amidst lingering distrust, could yield greater rewards than constant conflict.
By 200ED, the Khamadmi population had been reduced to the point where they no longer posed an existential threat to human survival. While still present, the creatures were confined to more remote areas, no longer capable of large-scale attacks on human settlements. The surviving tribes, now more stable and confident, began to expand their influence, exploring further inland and seeking new resources to sustain their growing numbers. The campaign had not only secured the exiles’ immediate survival but also set a precedent for cooperative endeavors that would shape the emerging society of Igir.
The Khamadmi Extermination Campaign was a significant chapter in the history of the Era of Desolation. It demonstrated the potential of unity forged in necessity, a lesson that would be echoed in the coming centuries as the tribes continued to struggle, adapt, and evolve toward a more stable existence. Though the concept of enduring unity was still distant, the campaign laid the groundwork for the strategic and collaborative efforts that would eventually lead to the Age of Unity.

The Discovery of New Wildlife (200 - 220ED)
The Curiosities of Youth

With the Khamadmi threat significantly reduced by 200ED, the survivors of Igir found themselves in a rare moment of respite. While the land remained harsh and resources still scarce, the absence of constant predation allowed the tribes to focus more on exploration and resource gathering. The need for survival had shifted from immediate conflict to a longer-term quest for sustainable living. It was during this pivotal period that two neighboring tribes, the Khomi and Dinyu, inadvertently set the stage for one of the most significant discoveries in early Igiri history.
Despite a general rule against mingling with other tribes, two young members—Srul̴ of the Khomi and Yinesh of the Dinyu—met unexpectedly while foraging near the borderlands between their territories. Both tribes had established camps close to a central forest, but neither had ventured far beyond due to lingering fears of the Khamadmi and the unfamiliar terrain. However, curiosity and the desire for more resources drove the two teenagers beyond the established safe zones.
In the early morning of 201ED, Srul̴ and Yinesh, fueled by a mix of youthful bravery and recklessness, agreed to explore the uncharted land further inland. They ventured toward the thin, spiky mountains visible from their camps, a region previously avoided by both tribes due to the dense foliage and rough terrain. As they navigated through this unfamiliar landscape, they were surprised to find a peculiar abundance of plant life and a marked decrease in Khamadmi presence. The air grew cooler, and the soil underfoot was softer, suggesting a more fertile environment.
Their journey took them to a cluster of five small lakes nestled among the foothills of the mountains. The lakes were surrounded by lush vegetation, including several new species of flowering plants. In this secluded region, Srul̴ and Yinesh made a groundbreaking discovery—three previously unknown species of mammals, each uniquely adapted to the emerging ecosystem of Igir.
The first species they encountered was the Yassa, a medium-sized marsupial-rodent hybrid. The Yassa had a thick, bushy tail and sharp, chisel-like teeth, perfect for gnawing on tough roots and tree bark. It was timid but curious, and its soft fur provided a potential source of warmth for the tribes, should they manage to capture and domesticate it.
The second discovery was the Krom, a peculiar quadruped with a long, thin neck and winding, bramble-like horns. These horns were not just for defense but also served an extraordinary ecological purpose—they carried seeds from the plants the Krom grazed upon. Some Krom had vines trailing from their horns, while others bore patches of moss or even blooming flowers. This symbiosis between animal and plant made the Krom a critical factor in the region’s expanding biodiversity. Srul̴ and Yinesh were captivated by this unusual creature, which seemed to embody the potential for harmonious coexistence between the evolving flora and fauna of Igir.
The third and most formidable discovery was the Al̴anikh, a massive arthropod with long, segmented legs, powerful claws, and a thick exoskeleton. The Al̴anikh was primarily a scavenger but could also be an aggressive predator when provoked. Its size and strength suggested that it played a major role in keeping the Khamadmi away from the region, as its powerful claws could easily puncture the softer underbelly of a Khamadmi. Srul̴ and Yinesh approached the Al̴anikh with caution, observing it from a safe distance before retreating to share their findings with their respective tribes.
Upon their return, Srul̴ and Yinesh reported their discoveries to the elders of the Khomi and Dinyu tribes. Initially skeptical, the elders were eventually convinced by the detailed accounts and the samples of unusual plants the teenagers had brought back. The Khomi and Dinyu elders, wary of repeating the mistakes made during the Feast of Shadows, agreed that this newfound abundance of resources must be handled carefully. They feared that the other tribes might overexploit the wildlife, leading to further conflict and instability.
By 205ED, both tribes had begun a slow, deliberate movement toward the lakes. The Khomi settled in the northeastern forests, while the Dinyu occupied the southwestern fields. The migration was carefully managed to avoid direct confrontations, but it brought the two tribes into closer proximity than ever before. This proximity heightened the need for clear communication and mutual understanding, as the region’s delicate ecosystem could not support large-scale exploitation.
As they settled into the new territory, Srul̴ and Yinesh continued to foster their bond, meeting secretly to discuss strategies for peaceful coexistence between their tribes. Their efforts were not solely for personal benefit; both understood that the long-term survival of their people depended on cooperation. However, they also recognized the risks of openly advocating for such cooperation, fearing backlash from tribal members still wary of other groups.
The next significant development came in 210ED, when the first signs of potential conflict emerged over shared resources. Small disputes broke out over hunting rights and water access, threatening to unravel the tentative peace. Sensing the potential for larger conflicts, Srul̴ and Yinesh took bold steps. They persuaded their elders to meet in neutral territory, hoping to negotiate agreements on resource distribution. This decision set the stage for the first formal diplomatic meeting in Igiri history.
By 220ED, the Khomi and Dinyu tribes had not only managed to maintain a fragile peace but had also established a foundation for a more structured form of diplomacy. Their mutual dependence on the new ecosystem fostered a sense of shared responsibility. This budding cooperation was not just a matter of survival; it marked the early stirrings of a more unified approach to life on Igir.
The First Diplomacy (220 - 235ED)
Mutual Interest

The cautious migrations of the Khomi and Dinyu tribes into the newly discovered central region of Igir had brought them into unprecedented proximity. Though the initial settlement was peaceful, the shared resources of the lakes and surrounding forests became points of tension as both tribes sought to establish their presence. By 220ED, small disputes over hunting grounds, fishing rights, and access to freshwater began to flare up, threatening to disrupt the fragile coexistence the tribes had managed to achieve.
Sensing the potential for a larger conflict, the elders of both tribes recognized the need for direct negotiation. This was a radical departure from the established norms of the Era of Desolation, where tribal interactions had been defined by either isolation or violent competition. The initiative for this unprecedented meeting was driven in part by Srul̴ and Yinesh, whose secret bond had continued to flourish amidst the broader tensions. Both had risen to greater prominence within their respective tribes, advocating for a cooperative approach to resource management.
In early 222ED, the elders of the Khomi and Dinyu agreed to convene in a neutral zone—a small clearing on the southern shore of the largest lake. The gathering was tense, with each tribe bringing a handful of guards to ensure safety. The air was thick with mistrust, as memories of past betrayals and the brutal struggles of the Feast of Shadows lingered in the minds of those present. Yet, the urgency of the situation outweighed old grievances, as both tribes understood that continued discord could lead to mutual destruction.
The negotiations were led by Elder Vashka of the Khomi and Elder Nyol̴i of the Dinyu. Vashka, a pragmatic leader with a deep understanding of his people’s needs, sought a fair distribution of resources that would benefit both tribes without giving too much ground. Nyol̴i, meanwhile, emphasized the need for a clear agreement on territorial boundaries and seasonal access to the lakes. The talks were slow, punctuated by long silences and the occasional flare-up of tempers. However, the presence of Srul̴ and Yinesh, who served as informal mediators, helped to keep the discussions focused.
The breakthrough came on the third day of negotiations, when Vashka proposed a system of alternating access to key resources. This arrangement would allow both tribes to fish and hunt in different zones depending on the season, preventing overexploitation and reducing the likelihood of direct competition. Nyol̴i agreed, suggesting a further measure: the establishment of a shared storage area for surplus food, where both tribes could contribute and draw from in times of scarcity. This proposal was a significant step forward, as it demonstrated a willingness to invest in the long-term stability of the region.
By the end of 222ED, the Khomi and Dinyu tribes had signed the first known diplomatic agreement in Igiri history. It was a simple document, carved into a large flat stone that was placed near the lakeshore as a symbol of the newfound cooperation. The agreement included clear terms for resource sharing, territorial boundaries, and dispute resolution. While not a formal alliance, it marked the beginning of a more structured relationship between tribes, one that went beyond mere survival.
The impact of this diplomatic breakthrough was immediate and significant. Relations between the Khomi and Dinyu improved, and minor disputes were resolved through the agreed-upon mechanisms rather than through violence. Children from both tribes began to play together near the lakes, and informal exchanges of goods—such as furs, feathers, and precious stones—became more common. The shared storage area proved useful during a minor drought in 224ED, reinforcing the value of mutual aid.
However, the success of this diplomatic effort was not without its challenges. Members of both tribes remained skeptical, wary that the agreement might be a ploy for eventual domination. Tensions occasionally flared, particularly when hunting parties from one tribe ventured too close to the other’s designated territory. It was during one of these incidents in 226ED that Srul̴ and Yinesh, now respected figures in their tribes, intervened to prevent an outbreak of violence. Their actions further solidified their roles as key advocates for peace, and their bond became a symbol of the potential for unity amidst the enduring mistrust.
By 230ED, the Khomi and Dinyu tribes had not only managed to maintain their diplomatic agreement but had also begun to explore new forms of cooperation. Joint hunts for the Yassa became more common, as did collaborative efforts to domesticate the animal. The tribes also exchanged knowledge about medicinal plants and crafting techniques, slowly weaving a more integrated cultural fabric. This process was not always smooth—cultural differences often led to misunderstandings—but it was marked by a growing sense of mutual respect.
The First Diplomacy laid the foundation for more structured intertribal relations in Igir. It demonstrated that cooperation, though fragile, was not only possible but also beneficial in the harsh landscape of the Era of Desolation. As the Khomi and Dinyu elders passed on the knowledge and terms of their agreement to younger generations, the seeds of unity were further sown, preparing the way for more ambitious attempts at unification in the future.

Unbreakable Bonds (235 - 265ED)
A Rare Meeting
With the First Diplomacy firmly established by 235ED, the Khomi and Dinyu tribes entered a new phase of relations, marked by collaboration and mutual benefit. The agreement forged between Elder Vashka of the Khomi and Elder Nyol̴i of the Dinyu had not only ensured resource sharing but had also sparked an unexpected cultural exchange. The children, who played together near the lakes, became a bridge between tribes, learning each other’s languages, customs, and games. Women from both tribes began to share cooking methods and medicinal knowledge, while hunters and artisans exchanged techniques for trapping, crafting, and survival.
Among the key figures of this era were Srul̴ and Yinesh, the two young men whose bond had been central to initiating the tribes’ cooperation. Now in their early thirties, both had risen to the ranks of their respective village councils—Srul̴ as a prominent hunter among the Khomi, and Yinesh as the trade manager for the Dinyu. Their influence played a crucial role in maintaining the peace and pushing for further integration. Their bond, once secretive and cautious, became a public symbol of the strength that could arise from unity.
The years following the initial diplomacy were not without challenges. In 238ED, a severe storm struck the region, flooding the lowlands and damaging the shared storage area near the lakes. The flooding caused significant losses to both tribes’ food reserves, threatening the fragile peace. However, instead of reverting to competition, the tribes came together in a remarkable display of solidarity. Elders Vashka and Nyol̴i coordinated a joint effort to rebuild the storage area on higher ground, ensuring that future floods would not pose the same risk. This collaborative response not only mitigated the immediate crisis but also reinforced the tribes’ commitment to their agreement.
As the years passed, the integration between the Khomi and Dinyu deepened. In 245ED, the tribes initiated their first formal joint venture: a large hunt for the Krom, whose unique plant-bearing horns were increasingly recognized as valuable for the region’s reforestation efforts. The Krom hunt, led by Srul̴ and Yinesh, was a landmark event. It demonstrated the tribes’ ability to plan, organize, and execute a complex operation together. The successful hunt yielded not only meat and furs but also new opportunities for domestication, as several young Krom were captured alive for potential breeding.
In 252ED, a defining moment occurred that would later be known as the Bonding Feast. During a routine trading caravan exchange between the tribes, a large Al̴anikh suddenly emerged from the surrounding brush, charging directly toward Yinesh. The Dinyu elder, caught off guard, was almost certain to be crushed under the creature’s massive claws. In a moment of decisive bravery, Srul̴ grabbed his long-spear, thrusting it into the Al̴anikh’s throat and pinning its head to the ground. The forward motion of the creature forced it onto its hind legs, where Srul̴’s guards rushed in to aid in its final defeat.
This act of bravery not only saved Yinesh’s life but also cemented the trust between the two tribes. In the aftermath, the tribes held a grand feast to honor Srul̴’s courage, but also to acknowledge the Al̴anikh as a symbol of the land’s harsh but sacred balance. The feast was marked by a solemn recognition of the challenges both tribes faced together, as well as a celebration of their growing unity. It was the first event where the Khomi and Dinyu tribes openly referred to one another as “brothers of the lakes,” signifying a deeper bond that transcended mere diplomacy.
Over the next decade, the integration of the tribes continued at a steady pace. By 260ED, it was common to see mixed groups of Khomi and Dinyu working together in hunting parties, trade caravans, and even in the shared construction of new shelters. This level of cooperation, almost unthinkable just a few generations prior, became a defining feature of life around the central lakes. The children born during this era, many of whom had friendships spanning both tribes, embodied a new cultural identity that blended Khomi and Dinyu traditions.
The unthinkable, however, eventually arrived. In 263ED, Srul̴, the Khomi elder and symbol of intertribal unity, succumbed to an illness that had swept through his tribe. His death was deeply felt not only by the Khomi but also by the Dinyu, who had come to see him as an ally and friend. A large funeral was held near the lakes, attended by members of both tribes. Yinesh, devastated by the loss of his lifelong friend, spoke at the funeral, praising Srul̴ not just as a brave warrior, but as a man who had truly believed in the power of unity.
The death of Srul̴ could have marked a setback for relations between the tribes. However, his legacy was carried forward by his successor, Myesh, a hunter who had been a key figure in maintaining intertribal relations. Myesh, known for his dedication to preserving peace, vowed to uphold the spirit of cooperation that Srul̴ had championed. He worked closely with Yinesh, who continued to serve as the trade manager for the Dinyu, to ensure that the bond between the two tribes remained strong.
In 265ED, Yinesh, too, passed away—this time of old age. His funeral, like Srul̴’s, was a joint affair, attended by both tribes. The Dinyu held a grand feast in his honor, celebrating his life, achievements, and commitment to the unity of the tribes. His successor, L̴aksho, was equally committed to maintaining the peace. With both tribes now fully invested in the long-term success of their cooperation, the bonds forged over the past three decades had become unbreakable.
The Unbreakable Bonds era marked a transformative period in the Era of Desolation. It was a testament to the potential for lasting peace, even in a land shaped by brutality and hardship. The relationship between the Khomi and Dinyu would serve as a model for other tribes in the coming centuries, demonstrating that unity could be not just a means of survival but a source of strength and prosperity. As the Era of Desolation continued, the foundation for broader alliances and the eventual Age of Unity was being built, one bond at a time.

The Flintforge Revolution (265 - 285ED)
A Useful Stone

By 265ED, the unity established between the Khomi and Dinyu tribes had demonstrated the benefits of cooperation amidst Igir's harsh landscape. While their bond was a symbol of hope, the broader region still struggled with division and isolation. At this time, Igir was home to eleven surviving tribes: Dyenra, Dinyu, Udrade, Kokhran, Khomi, Khasaldi, Kl̴enka, Dl̴ush, Radye, Myoras, and the Shidyona. Each tribe operated independently, constantly vying for territory and resources while navigating the continent’s unforgiving environment.
The Shidyona, known for their resilience, inhabited the rocky and barren Arid Mountains in the east. Their tools were primarily crafted from volcanic rock, which was sharp but brittle, limiting their effectiveness. However, in 267ED, Shidyona foragers made a significant discovery that would transform the technological landscape of Igir: flint. While searching for sources of fresh water at the base of a crumbling cliff, they stumbled upon veins of this hard, sharp-edged stone embedded within the rocky terrain.
Flint was unlike any material the Shidyona had worked with before. When struck against harder rock, it produced sparks that made fire-starting easier, a major boon for a tribe accustomed to harsh, cold nights. More importantly, flint’s durability and versatility enabled the crafting of stronger, sharper tools and weapons. The Shidyona, known for their ingenuity, quickly adapted their tool-making techniques to include flint, producing sharper knives, spearheads, and scrapers. These new tools allowed for more efficient hunting and resource gathering, providing the Shidyona with a critical advantage in the region.
News of the Shidyona’s discovery spread quickly among the other tribes. Flint was an immediate game-changer—its superior cutting edge could be used for both hunting and survival tasks. The Shidyona began trading flint tools with nearby tribes, including the Kokhran and Myoras, who were among the first to recognize its value. The Kokhran, situated in the foothills of central Igir, found flint especially useful for hunting Krom and other large prey, while the Myoras, skilled crafters, experimented with flint-tipped arrows and improved woodworking techniques.
The emergence of flint technology sparked what would later be called the Flintforge Revolution, a period of rapid innovation and adaptation across Igir. Flint knives replaced volcanic rock blades, allowing for cleaner cuts and faster processing of game. Flint-tipped spears, harder and more effective, became the standard for hunting and defense. Tribes that had struggled with inconsistent tool quality now experienced greater success in hunting and resource gathering. The Dl̴ush and Radye, known for their wide-ranging exploration, began to actively seek flint deposits within their own territories, driving a wave of exploration across the continent.
As flint became more widely available, trade networks expanded, fostering increased interaction among the eight tribes. While mistrust and rivalry persisted, the benefits of trading flint tools and knowledge outweighed the risks of isolation. Exchanges often took place at neutral sites, with tribes trading not only flint but also furs, medicinal herbs, and other resources. This growing web of trade signified the early stages of economic interdependence—a critical step toward broader cooperation.
However, the rapid spread of flint technology also led to conflicts over control of flint deposits. In 273ED, tensions flared between the Kl̴enka and Dl̴ushˠ tribes over a newly discovered flint vein along their border. Several skirmishes broke out as both tribes sought exclusive access to the resource. These clashes highlighted the persistent competition for power and resources, even as the tribes recognized the potential benefits of shared access to flint.
Despite these challenges, the Flintforge Revolution fundamentally shifted the way tribes interacted with their environment and each other. The Udrade, who lived near dense forests, began using flint tools to clear small areas of land for limited attempts at agriculture. Early farming efforts focused on cultivating Doya, a hardy root vegetable that had become a staple food source. With more reliable tools, the Udrade’s success in producing a steady food supply prompted other tribes to explore similar agricultural practices, albeit on a small scale.
By 280ED, flint tools had become widespread among all eight tribes, drastically improving survival rates and resource management. While flint technology did not erase the deep-seated divisions among tribes, it did foster a greater sense of intertribal awareness and dialogue. The shared need for flint encouraged tribes to negotiate resource-sharing agreements, which, though fragile, represented a step forward in the development of diplomacy on Igir.
The Shidyona, whose discovery had sparked this transformation, gained considerable influence during this period. They became respected as both traders and innovators, frequently sought out for advice on flint tool crafting. This newfound prestige strengthened the tribe’s position, elevating them from relative obscurity to a central player in the evolving dynamics of Igir.
The Flintforge Revolution was a defining moment in the Era of Desolation. It demonstrated humanity’s capacity to innovate and adapt, even in the harshest conditions. Flint, a simple but vital resource, became a symbol of resilience and ingenuity, bridging the gap between survival and the early stages of civilization. While unity remained a distant ideal, the lessons learned during this era—cooperation, resource management, and the sharing of knowledge—laid a crucial foundation for the eventual Age of Unity.

The Birth of Civilization (285 - 300ED)
Flourishment of Alliance

By 285ED, the Flintforge Revolution had reached all 11 tribes of Igir—Dyenra, Udrade, Kokhran, Kl̴enka, Dl̴ush, Radye, Myoras, Shidyona, Dinyu, Khomi, and Khasaldi. Flint tools had drastically improved hunting, resource management, and early attempts at agriculture, fostering cautious trade and diplomacy. Yet the continent remained divided by old rivalries and competition for resources, with tribes often clashing over territory. It was within this fragmented landscape that a visionary leader from the Kokhran tribe, named Niroklo, began to reshape the fate of Igir.
Niroklo was raised in the Kokhran tribe, located at the heart of Igir’s central region. The Kokhran were strategically positioned in the lush valley near the central mountains, which offered both natural defenses and access to vital resources like water, game, and flint. Niroklo grew up amidst tales of the Feast of Shadows and the struggles of earlier generations, but he was not content with mere survival. He believed in the potential for a unified Igiri civilization, one built on cooperation rather than constant conflict.
In 287ED, a sudden Khamadmi onslaught struck the Kokhran’s territory from the western mountain slopes. These beasts descended in overwhelming numbers, taking advantage of the mountainous cover. Niroklo, wielding his Khudryin—a polearm with a sword-like blade—led the defense, managing to repel some of the attackers while directing the retreat of Kokhran survivors. The attack left the Kokhran weakened and exposed, and Niroklo knew that the Kokhran could not withstand the Khamadmi alone.
Determined to form alliances, Niroklo set out to contact the Dl̴ush tribe to the southeast, situated near the same mountain range but farther down along the rugged slopes. The Dl̴ushˠ had always been wary of outsiders, their camp nestled amid rocky outcroppings that provided natural barriers. Niroklo, accompanied by two Kokhran warriors, made the arduous journey south through steep trails and dense forests, finally reaching the Dl̴ushˠ settlement. They were met with suspicion, as the Dl̴ush guards raised their spears in defense.
Niroklo requested a meeting with the Dl̴ush elder, Torvin, emphasizing the urgency of his mission. “We can no longer survive alone,” he urged. “The Khamadmi grow stronger, and we must unite to stand against them. We have refuge in the central mountains; join us, and let us defend our people together.” Torvin, a seasoned leader with a deep understanding of the region’s dangers, agreed to accompany Niroklo back to the Kokhran territory to see the situation firsthand.
The return journey was fraught with danger. As they neared the midpoint between the Kokhran and Dl̴ush camps, two Khamadmi ambushed the group. Torvin’s guards were caught off guard, and Torvin himself was gravely wounded. Niroklo, with his Khudryin, managed to fend off the Khamadmi, delivering swift, precise strikes that brought both creatures down. His bravery and skill left a strong impression on Torvin and the remaining Dl̴ush warriors, solidifying their trust.
Upon returning to the Kokhran settlement, Torvin, now convinced of the need for an alliance, pledged the support of the Dl̴ush tribe. Word of Niroklo’s bold actions spread quickly, and emissaries were sent to nearby tribes, including the Udrade and Myoras, who occupied territories east of the Kokhran. The Udrade were based in the fertile plains beyond the mountains, while the Myoras inhabited dense forests along the lower foothills. Both tribes, known for their pragmatic leadership, saw the benefits of a united front against the Khamadmi and other threats, and they agreed to join Niroklo’s alliance.
However, not all tribes were as open to the idea of unity. The Kl̴enka, situated in the northernmost peaks of the central mountain range, were fiercely territorial and suspicious of other tribes’ intentions. When emissaries reached their camp, they were met with hostility. Dekkor, the Kl̴enka elder, was dismissive of Niroklo’s vision, seeing it as an encroachment on Kl̴enka autonomy. “Do they know you’ve come to us?” Dekkor asked with a smirk. The emissaries replied honestly, “No, we seek others to follow Niroklo’s vision.” Dekkor, angered by the potential loss of influence, signaled his guards to eliminate the emissaries. “Ready the Khamadmi tamers,” he ordered coldly. “We will crush this so-called unity before it reaches our peaks.”
Meanwhile, Niroklo’s coalition continued to strengthen. By 290ED, it included four tribes: Kokhran, Dl̴ush, Udrade, and Myoras. The coalition remained fragile, bound more by the necessity of mutual defense than by a shared ideology. Niroklo understood that to sustain this alliance, he needed a unifying set of principles that transcended mere survival. In 295ED, he introduced the idea of the Moral Tablet, a set of guiding virtues intended to foster trust, fairness, and collective well-being. These values were not only practical but also spiritual, inspired by Ijalla, the Mother of Existence.
The introduction of the Moral Tablet was met with mixed reactions. Some tribes embraced the virtues as a means to build a more cohesive society, while others remained skeptical, viewing them as idealistic in a still-hostile world. Nevertheless, the tablet marked the first formal attempt to establish a shared moral foundation, reflecting Niroklo’s broader vision of a united Igir.
The Birth of Civilization marked the beginning of Igir’s transition from fragmented survival to a more structured and cooperative society. Niroklo’s coalition, though fragile and contested, laid the groundwork for what would eventually become the Age of Unity. As the alliance expanded and more tribes joined, the continent inched closer to a new era defined by shared values, strategic alliances, and a collective effort to overcome the harsh challenges of Igir’s landscape.

The Kl̴enka's Reckoning (300 - 310ED)
An Unprovoked Assault

By the year 300ED, Niroklo’s coalition of tribes—Kokhran, Dl̴ush, Udrade, and Myoras—had strengthened its position across central Igir. The alliance had begun to establish fortified settlements near the mountain range, with Niroklo’s vision of unity further fueled by the growing acceptance of the Moral Tablet. However, this progress was not without resistance. The Kl̴enka, deeply entrenched in the northern peaks of the central mountains, remained fiercely opposed to Niroklo’s growing influence. They viewed the coalition as a direct threat to their autonomy and their control over critical resources in the region.
Dekkor, the Kl̴enka elder, was determined to crush the coalition before it gained further momentum. He commanded his tribe’s Khamadmi tamers to launch a decisive strike against Niroklo’s stronghold in the central valleys. The Kl̴enka’s cunning over the wild Khamadmi was unparalleled; through generations of trial and error, they had developed techniques to lure and direct the creatures for strategic attacks. Dekkor’s plan was to unleash a swarm of Khamadmi into the valley settlements, intending to create chaos and weaken the coalition’s morale.
In early 302ED, the Kl̴enka’s attack began. Using baited traps and loud reverberating instruments designed to mimic the Khamadmi’s territorial calls, they managed to drive a considerable number of the creatures into the coalition’s settlements. The initial impact was devastating. The Khamadmi, powerful and frenzied, tore through the defenses, leaving Niroklo’s warriors scrambling to defend their people. The assault threatened to fracture the fragile alliance, as panic spread among the tribes.
However, Niroklo quickly recognized that direct combat would only result in further casualties. He gathered his closest advisors, including Torvin of the Dl̴ush and Yoreir of the Myoras, to devise a counter-strategy that did not rely on brute force. Niroklo proposed an audacious plan: rather than attempting to kill the Khamadmi, they would redirect the creatures back toward the Kl̴enka’s own territory. The coalition’s scouts had observed that the Khamadmi, once agitated, would follow distinct territorial markers and scents—an instinct that could be manipulated.
The coalition’s warriors, working swiftly under Niroklo’s direction, set up a series of lures made from strong-smelling animal fats mixed with the scent of the Kl̴enka fabrics. The bait was strategically placed along the lower slopes of the mountains, creating a trail that led directly toward the Kl̴enka stronghold. At the same time, drums and horn blasts were used to guide the Khamadmi along this path. The tactic required precise coordination and immense courage, as warriors had to position the lures while avoiding the Khamadmi’s frenzied attacks.
The strategy worked better than expected. The Khamadmi, driven by their aggressive instincts and the familiar scent of their handlers, turned away from the coalition’s settlements and surged toward the northern peaks. By mid-303ED, the swarm reached the Kl̴enka’s territory, creating chaos within their stronghold. The very creatures that had been used as weapons now became a dire threat to their masters. The Kl̴enka, unprepared for such a reversal, found themselves overwhelmed by the Khamadmi they had sought to control.
The sudden Khamadmi invasion forced the Kl̴enka into a difficult decision. With their defenses compromised and their resources dwindling, Dekkor realized that continuing to hold the northern peaks was no longer viable. The tribe began a hasty retreat, abandoning their mountain stronghold in favor of a safer location. By 305ED, the Kl̴enka had resettled on the western shores of Igir, beyond the mountain range. The move was driven not by defeat in battle but by a clever tactic that turned their own strength against them.
The successful redirection of the Khamadmi was a significant victory for Niroklo’s coalition, not only securing the central valleys but also demonstrating the effectiveness of strategic thinking over sheer force. It also sent a powerful message to the remaining tribes: the coalition was capable of both defense and cunning, making it a formidable entity in the increasingly complex landscape of Igir.
The Kl̴enka’s relocation marked the beginning of a new chapter for the tribe. While they had lost their position in the northern mountains, they found new opportunities on the western shore, a region rich in untapped resources. Though this move would eventually lead to the founding of a significant coastal city in the coming centuries, for now, it signified a major shift in Igiri geopolitics—one that consolidated Niroklo’s coalition as the dominant force in central Igir.
The Kl̴enka's Reckoning was more than just a tactical victory; it represented a turning point in the Era of Desolation. It proved that survival and growth depended not just on physical strength but on ingenuity and adaptability. Niroklo’s coalition, having successfully defended its position, was now poised to continue expanding its influence, and it was at this time that the Era of Desolation came to an end. Niroklo proposed the beginning of a new age, aptly named the Age of Unity (AU), and named his coalition Khomakl̴u, which in the Anili dialect of Butrani was defined as “Gentle People.”
The establishment of Khomakl̴u marked the formal beginning of a unified effort to bring peace and stability to Igir. While the challenges of true unity remained, the tribes now had a name and a guiding principle to rally around. The first steps of the Age of Unity would be shaped by the coalition’s efforts to integrate more tribes into its fold, solidify its governing structure, and maintain the virtues that had brought them together. The ideals of Niroklo and his coalition now stood as a beacon for the future, setting the stage for a new era of hope and collaboration.
